### For this homework we had to create a firebase database and then use that databse in our homework to display user input into the firebase.

### Instructions given to us -
" * Train Time** (Recommended)
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station."
